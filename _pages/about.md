Working as an Insight and Analytics Executive at Vodafone Business, and gearing my career in the direction of Data Science, this site will hold details of my progress and future endeavours.

I currently hold a BSc in Mathematics, Operational Research and Statistics and a Postgraduate Certificate in Computer Science. I am excited to be joining UEL as a Data Science Doctoral candidate this September.

I will be undertaking the doctorate on a part-time basis with the intention of directing my research towards geosocial networks online in comparison with access to, and use of, Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services in the UK.

I am passionate about continuous development, representation of women in STEM (especially data!) and mental health/wellbeing.

Watch this space over the following few months as I bring my site together and embark on a steep learning curve in my professional role.
