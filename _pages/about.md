Working as an Insight and Analytics Executive at Vodafone Business, and gearing my career in the direction of Data Science, this site will hold details of my progress and future endeavours.

In my free time, I'm studying for Professional Doctorate in Data Science at the University of East London. I hope to direct my research towards geosocial networks online in comparison with access to, and use of, Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services in the UK but for the meantime am working on the taught modules, starting with Data Ecology.

I am passionate about continuous development, representation of women in STEM (especially data!) and mental health/wellbeing.

Watch this space over the following few months as I bring my site together and embark on a steep learning curve in my professional role.
