Working as an Insight and Analytics Executive at Vodafone Business, and gearing my career in the direction of Data Science, this site will hold details of my progress and future endeavours.
I currently hold a BSc in Mathematics, Operational Research and Statistics and am awaiting results for a Postgraduate Certificate in Computer Science with Data Analytics with the University of York.
Assuming all is well, I'll be joining the University of East London in September 2021 as a Data Science Professional Doctorate student, which I will be undertaking on a part-time basis. I hope to pull my research towards the presence of geosocial networks online across the UK in comparison with access to, and use of, Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services.

I am passionate about continuous development, representation of women in STEM (especially data!) and mental health/wellbeing.

Watch this space over the following few months as I bring my site together and embark on a steep learning curve in my professional role.
