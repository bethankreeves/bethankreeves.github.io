Insight and Analytics Executive is go! 
======

Having recently (re)joined Vodafone UK, in a data science and insight team, I am learning _so_ much including brushing up on my SQL and Python,
with R and cloud technologies to come. Of course, I am also getting my head around this area of the company, VF Business, as it's a sector I've not had
the chance to explore before. 

I am **super** excited to have started this role, it is something I've been after for a long time. The opportunity to upskill in data science whilst 
putting it all into practice on the job is a priceless one for me right now. When working at Vodafone previously, I was searching for this type 
of role but at that point there just wasn't the scope for it. Thankfully, all things work out as they are meant to be and it has come up at the perfect 
time as it will complement my studies and research fantastically. 

Going forwards, I hope to document some of my experiences on this professional area of my site 👩🏼‍💻
